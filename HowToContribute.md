# Introduction #

We'd be very happy and accept contributions and ideas from others.  There's two ways of contributing: contributing a Patch, or joining the project.

## Contributing a Patch ##
If you come across a bug which you'd like to fix and contribute back, this is the easiest and less involved way of contributing. [Scott Hanselman has a good overview of how to contribute using TortoiseSVN (our favorite SVN client)](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExampleHowToContributeAPatchToAnOpenSourceProjectLikeDasBlog.aspx).

## Joining the project ##
If you'd like to join the project, please drop us a line at the [TreeTrim Discussions list](http://groups.google.com/group/TreeTrim).
